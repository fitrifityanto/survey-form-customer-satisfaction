# Survey Form Customer Satisfaction

This is a survey form project that I made for a course at freecodecamp. 

I don't give a lot of css styles to this survey form, because the purpose of making a survey form is to be able to pass the test 🙏. 

Clean and simple design. 

Alhamdulillah, this survey form is in accordance with the given [rules](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form) 

The survey form page can be seen at this link [Customer Satisfaction Survey Form](https://fitrifityanto.github.io/survey-form-customer-satisfaction/)
